# 📝 Text Summarization - Preprocessing & Training

## 📌 Summary

This notebook builds a basic pipeline for text summarization using NLP and deep learning. It focuses on data loading, text cleaning, and preparing for model training.

---

## 💡 Objective

The goal is to summarize long news articles using advanced NLP techniques. The CNN/DailyMail dataset is used, which contains articles and their corresponding highlights (summaries).

---

## 📂 Data Handling

The dataset is read and cleaned by dropping irrelevant columns like `id`. Only the `article` and `highlights` columns are retained to work on summarization tasks.

---

## 🔍 Data Exploration

Some examples are printed to observe the difference between the original article and its summary, helping to understand the nature of the data.

---

## 🧹 Text Preprocessing

Text cleaning is done in multiple steps:
- Lowercasing the text
- Expanding contractions (e.g., "can’t" → "cannot")
- Removing stopwords
- Stripping unwanted symbols, HTML tags, and special characters

---

## ✅ Next Steps

The notebook likely continues with:
- Tokenization and sequence padding
- Encoder-decoder model with attention mechanism
- Training and evaluation using metrics like ROUGE

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python, Pandas, NLTK, TensorFlow
- CNN/DailyMail Dataset

This is the foundation for a text summarization model using deep learning!
